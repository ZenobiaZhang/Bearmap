stuck on a very small bug for 2 days!!!!
Didn't construct KDtree in the GraphDB constructor and every time I make a new KDTree it makes a new KDtree,so it takes even longer than my original closest() method!!!
However I didn't realize it and I spent 2days to rewrite the KDtree again and again.
It is really hard to find those little bugs..T^T
